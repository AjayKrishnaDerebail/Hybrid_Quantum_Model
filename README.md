PROPOSED MODEL

In our methodology, we have developed an architecture, as illustrated in Figure 1, 
taking into account the limitations identified in the literature survey. Our proposed 
system consists of six main stages: 1) Data pre-processing, 2) Embedding tweets 
using BERT, 3) Dimensionality reduction using UMAP, 4) Building Hybrid Quantum 
Model, 5) Classification layer.
